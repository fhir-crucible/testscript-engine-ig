### Execution Semantics

This complex extension is used within a TestScript assert action. It tells the engine to determine whether the assertion passed based on the execution of a specified TestScript for each of a set of inputs. The assert must also include a value in the `expression` element indicating a FHIRPath expression that will drive how many executions of the subtest will occur. For each entry in the result collection, which must be a string value, the specified TestScript will be executed with the entry value bound to a specified variable in the invoked TestScript. A boolean flag in the extension, `allMustPass`, tells the engine whether all iterations of the subtest execution must succeed in order for the assertion to pass, or just one. The extension also optionally includes variable bindings, tying the value of additional specific variables in the TestScript making the invocation to variables in the target TestScript. Once execution of all iterations of the invoked TestScript completes, TestReport instances are generated for each iteration, each with an [extension](StructureDefinition-executed-as-subtest.html) flagging that it was a subtest and another [extension](StructureDefinition-executed-as-subtest-must-pass.html) indicating whether it needed to pass based on the `allMustPass` value, and the engine continues with execution of the invoking TestScript.
